Wireless communication systems face many challenges due to fluctuating channel conditions
which lead to variable error rates and require robust error management tactics. Normal Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) methods suffer from high communication overhead and latency
and are very inefficient in handling retransmissions. Although traditional HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) is effective, its widespread use is limited by high implementation costs.
This underscores the need for adaptive systems that can dynamically respond to changing channel conditions based on Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) values. The proposed scheme switches
between ARQ, HARQ with Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes , and HARQ with
turbo codes based on channel conditions during the transmission. Further, this scheme incorporates a selective soft combining technique by estimating SNR at the receiver end. The
main goal is to achieve the maximum possible throughput even at very low SNR values while
maintaining optimal complexity.
